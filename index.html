      Croissants Are <span class="emphasis">Not</span> French?!
    </h1>
    <h2 class="mb-4">
      Believe it, or not. The typical French croissant is, in fact, Austrian.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The original croissant was called Kipfel and originated in Austria in
      1683. It was created in honor of the Austrian victory over the Turks and
      modeled after the crescent on the Turkish flag. (Some historians say the
      croissant originated in Hungary)
    </p>
    <h3 class="mb-4">Here are some other fun facts about the croissant</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        August Zang, an Austrian artillery officer, is credited with bringing
        the croissant to France when he opened his own Viennese bakery in Paris.
        (Some say it was Marie Antoinette who brought the croissant to
        France...)
      </li>
      <li>The Croissant became the French national product in 1920.</li>
      <li>
        The Croissant started as a luxury product, but by the end of the
        nineteenth century, it was middle-class (the rich preferred a good
        brioche).
      </li>
      <li>
        Before the modern croissant, puff pastry was used as a garnish or shell,
        not to eat on its own.
      </li>
    </ul>
